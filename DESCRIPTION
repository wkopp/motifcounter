Description: 'motifcounter' provides motif matching, motif counting
        and motif enrichment functionality based on position
        frequency matrices.
        The main features of the packages include the utilization
        of higher-order background models and accounting
        for self-overlapping motif matches when determining motif enrichment. 
        The background model allows to capture dinucleotide 
        (or higher-order nucleotide) composition adequately
        which may reduced model biases and misleading results compared
        to using simple GC background models.
        When conducting a motif enrichment analysis 
        based on the motif match count, the package
        relies on a compound Poisson distribution or alternatively
        a combinatorial model. These distribution account for self-overlapping
        motif structures as exemplified by repeat-like or palindromic motifs,
        and allow to determine the p-value and fold-enrichment for 
        a set of observed motif matches.
