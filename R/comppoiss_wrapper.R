#' Compound Poisson Approximation
#'
#' This function approximates the distribution of the number of motif hits
#' that emerges from a random DNA sequence of a given length.
#' 
#' The distribution can be determined in two alternative ways:
#' \enumerate{
#' \item A re-implemented version of the algorithm that was
#' described in Pape et al. \emph{Compound poisson approximation
#' of the number of occurrences of a position
#' frequency matrix (PFM) on both strands.} 2008
#' can be invoked using method='pape'.
#' The main purpose of this implementation concerns 
#' benchmarking an improved approximation.
#' In contrast to the original model, this implementation 
#' can be used with general order-d Markov models.
#' \item We provide an improved compound Poisson approximation that
#' uses more appropriate statistical assumptions concerning
#' overlapping motif hits and that can be used with order-d
#' background models as well. The improved version is used by default
#' with method='kopp'.
#' Note: Only method='kopp' supports the computation
#' of the distribution of the number of motif hits w.r.t. scanning
#' a single DNA strand (see \code{\link{probOverlapHit}}).
#' }
#'
#'
#' @param seqlen Integer-valued vector that defines the lengths of the
#' individual sequences. For a given DNAStringSet, 
#' this information can be retrieved using \code{\link{numMotifHits}}.
#' @param overlap An Overlap object.
#' @param method String that defines which method shall be invoked: 'pape' or
#' 'kopp' (see description). Default: method = 'kopp'.
